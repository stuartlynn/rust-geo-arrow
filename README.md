# Rust-geo-arrow

This is a simple repo to test the viability of using geospatial arrow in rust and WASM.

Goals 

- [X] Load in a geospatial parquet file written using python geopandas and extract the geometries
- [ ] Do something useful with this information. 
- [ ] See if we can add geo formats to polars to be able to perform geopandas like operations with it.
